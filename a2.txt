CISC 457 Assignment 2
Due Tuesday, November 8, 2016 at 6:00pm

Students may work individually or in pairs on this assignment.

Modify the 'base' program provided in this archive to add the
following features:

0. Run the code.  Press '?' to see the options.  Read and understand
   all of the code, including the Complex class, which you will use.

1. Implement the FFT() function.  The necessary bit-reversal code is
   provided.  You should use the main FFT code from class.

     [2 marks] FFT code from class

2. Implement the FFT2D() function.  See the comments in that function.

     [2 marks] rows computation
     [2 marks] column computation

3. Implement the forwardFFT2D() function.  This just sets up the data
   and calls FFT2D().  But the data must be slightly modified so that
   the F.T. is centred in the window at (N/2,N/2).

     [2 marks] copy and centre (a bit tricky to get (-1)^(x+y) correct)
     [1 mark] call FFT2D() appropriately

4. Implement the inverseFFT2D() function.  This uses the FFT2D() as a
   black box, so requires that the conjugate of the F.T. be input to
   the black box, and that the real component of the result be stored
   after the computation is done.  You must normalize the real
   component (think about this).  You must also undo the effect of
   centring in step 3, above.

     [1 mark] form a copy of the complex conjugate
     [1 mark] call FFT2D() appropriately
     [1 mark] extract real part and normalize
     [1 mark] undo centring

5. Once the code works, use it to explore the FFT of the circle and
   gaussian images.  Do not hand anything in for this.  [0 marks]

6. Use your code to remove the noise from the noisy1.jpg, noisy2.png,
   and noisy3.png.  Submit the de-noised images and the F.T. of the
   de-noised images.

     [1 mark] good denoising of noisy1.jpg and noisy2.png
     [1 mark] good denoising of noisy3.jpg

7. Email to sijia.li@queensu.ca a zip archive containing these eight
   files, with exactly these names:

     [1 mark] for following these submission instructions *exactly*

     base.pde                   your code

     readme.txt                 your names and student numbers and any 
				comments you want to provide
